# Project Assignment: Black Friday Sales Dataset
## Objective:
This project aims to perform a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Black Friday sales dataset from Kaggle. This project will help you understand the data, uncover patterns, and gain insights into consumer behaviour during Black Friday sales.

## Dataset:
The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle: [Black Friday Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pranavuikey/black-friday-sales-eda). Make sure to read the dataset description to understand the features.

# Steps and Tasks:
## Part 1: Data Preprocessing
1. Load the Dataset:

- Load the dataset using pandas.
- Display the first few rows to understand the structure.
2. Data Cleaning:

- Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
- Ensure data types are correct for each column.
- Handle any outliers if necessary.
## Part 2: Univariate Analysis
1. Distribution Analysis:

- Plot histograms for continuous variables (e.g., Purchase).
- Plot bar charts for categorical variables (e.g., Gender, Age).
2. Summary Statistics:

- Calculate and interpret summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation) for key variables.
## Part 3: Bivariate Analysis
1. Relationship Analysis:

- Plot scatter plots to explore relationships between Purchase and other continuous variables.
- Use box plots and violin plots to compare Purchase distributions across different categories (e.g., Gender, Age).
2. Correlation Analysis:

- Calculate the correlation matrix for continuous variables.
- Visualize the correlation matrix using a heatmap.

## Part 4: Multivariate Analysis
1. Pair Plot:

- Create a pair plot to explore relationships between multiple variables simultaneously.
2. Facet Grid:

- Use facet grids to visualize the relationship between Purchase and other variables across different subsets of data (e.g., Age and Gender).
## Part 5: Advanced Visualizations
1. 3D Scatter Plot:

- Create a 3D scatter plot to visualize the relationship between three continuous variables.
2. Density Plot:

- Plot density plots to understand the distribution of Purchases for different categories.
3. Parallel Coordinates Plot:

- Use parallel coordinates to visualize multi-dimensional data and compare different categories.

## Part 6: Insights and Recommendations
1. Insights:

- Based on the visualizations and analysis, summarize the key insights.
- Identify patterns and trends in consumer behaviour during Black Friday sales.
2. Recommendations:

- Provide actionable recommendations for stakeholders (e.g., marketing strategies, inventory management).
## Part 7: Reporting
1. Report Creation:
- Compile your findings, visualizations, insights, and recommendations into a comprehensive report.
- Ensure the report is well-structured and easy to understand.


### Tools and Libraries:
- Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, mpl_toolkits.mplot3d, sklearn, geopandas
- Visualization Tools: Jupyter Notebook or any other IDE supporting Python.

### Deliverables:
- Jupyter Notebook with all code and visualizations.
- A detailed report summarizing your EDA process, findings, insights, and recommendations.


By the end of this project, you should have a solid understanding of how to perform EDA using advanced visualization techniques and be able to extract meaningful insights from the data. Good luck!
